A CUDA-based version of the code; this is based on the previous version of the code, 
but extended in ways to make it more CUDA friendly. 

It also contains some basic CUDA wrapping, but these are very specific to this
code.

The CUDA code is intended to be build as a separate shared library, and not built 
using the go tool.
